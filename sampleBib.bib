  abstract  = {Two players have to reach an agreement on the partition of a pie of size 1. Each has to
 make in turn, a proposal as to how it should be divided. After one player has made an
 offer, the other must decide either to accept it, or to reject it and continue the bargaining.
 Several properties which the players' preferences possess are assumed. The Perfect Equilib-
 rium Partitions (P.E.P.) are characterized in all the models satisfying these assumptions.
 Specially, it is proved that when every player bears a fixed bargaining cost for each
 period (cl and c2), then: (i) if cl {\textless} c2 the only P.E.P. gives all the pie to 1; (ii) if cl {\textgreater} c2 the
 only P.E.P. gives to I only c2.
 In the case where each player has a fixed discounting factor (83 and 82) the only P.E.P.
